# Portal
Frontend Administration based on Angular admin dashboard framework (ng2-admin) [http://akveo.com/ng2-admin]()

Run the following command from the project directory:

```
cd ng2-admin
npm start
```

Then point your browser to:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

##### Docker
```
docker-compose up
```

Notes: 
- The docker container takes a long time to download, build and compile dependencies.
- All instructions above run the "dev" mode which syncs `src` directory changes with the browser sessoin.
